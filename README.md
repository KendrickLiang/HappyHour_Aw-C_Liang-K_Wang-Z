### Our FINAL PROJECT is a sudoku solver.

Plan:
We intend to use a sudoku puzzle from online, and use an algorithm to try to 
solve the sudoku puzzle. Because sudoku is a recursive puzzle, the algorithm 
will be relatively simple. However, we will have to account for all the rows,
columns, and 3 by 3 sections of the puzzle.
