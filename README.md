### Our FINAL PROJECT is a sudoku solver.

Plan:
We intend to use a sudoku puzzle from online, and use an algorithm to try to 
solve the sudoku puzzle. Because sudoku is a recursive puzzle, the algorithm 
will be relatively simple. However, we will have to account for all the rows,
columns, and 3 by 3 sections of the puzzle.

Algorithm: 
The algorithm for solving the sudoku puzzle we will implement is similar to 
the queen rows algorithm because each row can only have one of each letter,
just like each row on a chess board can only have one queen if you were to try
to place n number of queens on a nxn board.
