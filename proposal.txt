We propose that our final project be on making a sudoku solver algorithm.

Precondition:
Given a 9 by 9 sudoku puzzle that is solvable

Plan:
Recursively go through the puzzle and find the solution

How it connects to what we learned:
A great chunk of the class was devoted to thinking recursively. This project would enable us to take this learning and apply it to a more complicated task.
