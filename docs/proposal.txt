# Proposal #

We propose that our final project be on making a sudoku solver algorithm.

Precondition:
Given a 9 by 9 sudoku puzzle that is solvable

Postcondition:
Solve the sudoku puzzle

Plan:
Recursively go through the puzzle and find the unique solution (We will be borrowing puzzles from online sources)
We will be following the rules of the traditional sudoku puzzle (checking rows, columns, 3 x 3)

How it connects to what we learned:
A great chunk of the class was devoted to thinking recursively. This project would enable us to take this learning and apply it to a more complicated task.

Additional Functionality (If time permits):
Report time it took to solve sudoku puzzle and data.
Have a human person vs AI compete to solve it.
Talk more about sudoku time complexity and Latin Squares
