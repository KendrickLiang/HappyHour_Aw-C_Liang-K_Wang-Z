PLAN:

CORE:
- Make a sudoku solver class or method in existing sudoku class
|
-> Improve robustness and functionality of our classes.

NON-ESSENTIAL:
- Make an empty sudoku puzzle for user to solve.
- Records times of computer vs the user. 
- Whenever one wins, displays a win/lose message and the time elapsed.
