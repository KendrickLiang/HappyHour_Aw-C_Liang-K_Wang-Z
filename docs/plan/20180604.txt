CURRENT STATUS:
- Classes and the essential methods leading up to the recursive step are written
- We are upto date with the current mandatory documents

PLAN:

CORE:
- Make a driver to begin seeing code in action (we need to think of a solid recursion)
- Improve the robustness and functionality of our class (i.e. exception errors)

NON-ESSENTIAL:
- Records time of computer to solve puzzle
- Make an empty sudoku puzzle for user to solve.

-> Maybe use processing after getting it to work in terminal.
- Whenever one wins, displays a win/lose message and the time elapsed.
